/**
 * CardMirror desktop — Electron main process.

 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Create and manage the BrowserWindow that hosts the renderer.
 *   - Drive native open/save dialogs and read/write files from disk
 *     in response to renderer IPC. (Renderer-side Host abstraction
 *     in `src/editor/host/electron-host.ts`.)
 *   - Define the native menu bar; menu picks dispatch to the

 *     through the same ribbon-command registry as keyboard
 *     shortcuts and ribbon buttons.
 *   - Host cross-window state: speech-doc registry, dropzone shelf,
 *     Quick Cards library, duplicate-open guard, crash-recovery
